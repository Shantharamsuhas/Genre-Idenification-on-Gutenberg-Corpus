# Genre-Idenification-on-Gutenberg-Corpus
 The task here consists of detection (i.e. classification) of genre3 of a book. Each
data-point in this classification task is a fiction book with a label (genre).The data set is
created from Project Gutenberg. The data set consists of about 1000 books and roughly
10 genres.


Tasks to be carried out were :
1)	Extract features that are relevant to fiction books, which may include ideas like
sentiment, setting4 and so on, using appropriate libraries.
2)	Outline which models you intend on using and why and how model selection was
performed.
3)	Explain how the evaluation of the model is being done and how the data set is to be
partitioned while taking into account potential challenges like class imbalances and
similar.
